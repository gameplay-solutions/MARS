# What is MARS?
MARS is a C++, Open Source, 3D Game Engine in development by Gameplay.Solutions. 
The goal of MARS is to be a Platform Agnostic solution to creating games, allowing anyone to be able to make a game regardless of the OS they are currently using.

The idea for MARS originally came about when we wanted to create something unique, something that was our own. 
A Game Engine seemed like a huge task and a large challenge which added to the the enjoyment of working on it.

MARS is 100% a passion project, we work on it because we enjoy it. If you think you might enjoy working on a project like this, feel free
to submit a pull request. We're open to feedback.
